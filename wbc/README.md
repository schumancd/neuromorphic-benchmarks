# Wisconsin Breast Cancer

 Though image classification or processing is the most popular use case of neuromorphic systems, there are many other types of data that could be processed by SNNs.  Even for relatively simple images, such as those in MNIST, the images themselves require a large number of inputs, which result in networks that have a minimum of hundreds of neurons.  Particularly for experimental hardware, it may be very difficult to build networks of this size to perform initial testing.  For our initial non-image data classification task, we select the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+\%28Original\%29). This dataset includes a total of 699 data points, where each data point includes nine features and a label.  The nine features regard diagnosing breast cancer and are reported in integer values between 1 and 10.  Those features correspond to the following measured values: clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses.  The label corresponds to either benign or malignant.  We have split this data into a training set of size 444 and a testing set of size 255.
